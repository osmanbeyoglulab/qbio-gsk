# Quantitative and computational biology

GSK Graduate School, Spring 2016

### Location: 

Zuckerman Research Center (**ZRC-138**)

### Summary: 

Students in this course will learn to apply quantitative exploratory
data analysis techniques to different forms of experimental data. The
course will begin with a software skills “bootcamp”, which will
introduce students to computing via the UNIX shell, and to computing in
the R programming language. The remaining lessons will be a blend of
practical skills and theoretical concepts. Students will become
comfortable performing exploratory data analysis, and will understand
how concepts from statistics underlie the tools they use. These skills
will enable them both to collaborate effectively with computational
biologists, as well as to carry out their own computational experiments.

Specific topics include: practical aspects of data formatting and
management; visualization of data and model parameters; an introduction
to probability, elementary statistics and hypothesis testing;
experimental design and tools for differential expression analysis in
RNA-seq and ChIP-seq; interpreting model fit, correct interpretation of
statistical evidence, and multiple hypothesis testing correction
methods; common data-structures for working with biological sequences;
enrichment testing for ranked gene sets; common bioinformatics tools and
data quality assessment tools; introduction to structural biology and
tools for visualization.

Towards the end of the course, students are encouraged to do a project
on bioinformatic data analysis and present their results in the last
class.

- Hatice Ulku Osmanbeyoglu ([*uosmanbey@gmail.com*](mailto:uosmanbey@gmail.com))

### Assessment:

This class will not be graded. However, periodic student surveys in
class and online are planned to assess if the presented material is
properly learnt. All students will also be asked to complete a survey at
the end of the course, to obtain feedback on the course and assess if
this experimental format is successful and what changes need to be done
when the course is offered in future years.

### Books and Materials: 

Students will need a laptop computer on which they can install software
(R and R Studio), and bring to class. All software used in the course is
free, and run on recent versions of Linux, Mac OS X, and Microsoft
Windows.

R: [*http://www.r-project.org*](http://www.r-project.org)
