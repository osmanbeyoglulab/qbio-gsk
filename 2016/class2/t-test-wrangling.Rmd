This is an R Markdown document. Think of it like a lab notebook that can dynamically run small amounts of computational experiments.  Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button (in Rstudio, one of the icons just below the open file tabs) a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
can <- read.csv(file = '~/qbio-gsk/data/cancer.csv')
is.data.frame(can)
```

Let's not deal with un-coded factor values, so we can label treatment groups (0,1) as (placebo, aloe juice):

```{r}
can$TRT.CODE <- factor(can$TRT, labels=c('Placebo','Aloe Juice'))
```

Now, we can test for differences in the scores by t-test

```{r}
t.test(can$TOTALCW4 ~ can$TRT.CODE, var.equal=FALSE)
```


I usually do not use this formulation (where R tests for differences in the TOTALCW4 var, stratifying groups by TRT.CODE)
but it works fine here, since we have complete data.  There does not seem to be a difference in treatment versus placebo here.

So, is the difference still not significant at TOTALCW6?

```{r,error=TRUE}
t.test(can$TOTALCW6 ~ can$TRT.CODE, var.equal=FALSE)
```

Whaaa??  Turns out this is a coersion issue, caused by the missing data encoded by '.'
Bear with me.

Let's try to compare the value directly, by getting a vector of values for placebo, aloe juice groups at week 6:

```{r}
placebo.vals <- subset(can, TRT.CODE == "Placebo" & TOTALCW6 != '.', as.numeric(TOTALCW6))
aloe.vals <- subset(can, TRT.CODE == "Aloe Juice" & TOTALCW6 != '.', as.numeric(TOTALCW6))
```


```{r,error=TRUE}
t.test(placebo.vals, aloe.vals)
```

Seems the problem is in trying to take the max() (or abs()) of our values.  

```{r,error=TRUE}
max(aloe.vals)
```

What's the type of this variable?

```{r}
typeof(aloe.vals)
```

Ah, maybe this is it.  t.test needs a vector maybe?

```{r}
aloe.vals <- unlist(aloe.vals)
aloe.vals
```

Aha.  The presence of '.' to encode missing data caused this column (or list) to be encoded as a factor, since the '.' could not be coerced to a numeric value in 'read.csv'
Let's explicitly cast the unlisted values to numeric, get a numeric vector:

```{r}
aloe.vals <- as.numeric(unlist(aloe.vals))
aloe.vals
```

Bingo.

```{r}
placebo.vals <- as.numeric(unlist(placebo.vals))
placebo.vals
```

Ready to test, finally: 

```{r}
t.test(placebo.vals, aloe.vals)
```
