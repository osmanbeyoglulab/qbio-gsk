Please drag and drop your homework (named 'firstname-lastname.pdf') into this folder.

Generate 10 points from a uniform distribution sampled from values between
0 and 10.
Compute the mean and the standard deviation of the data points that
you just generated.
Generate seven more datasets of 10 points each, sampled from the normal
distribution with the mean and standard deviation that you just computed.
Make a panel of eight QQ plots of the eight datasets youâ€™ve generated to
assess if the data looks like it is derived from the normal distribution.
Repeat all of the steps above, except this time each dataset should include
400 points.
