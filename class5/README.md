We will revisit the meaning of Pvalues, examine possible outcomes of high-throughput experiments by simulation, and introduce some concepts for multiple-hypothesis correction:
 - `git pull` the latest repo 
 - Pvalue notes will come from [here](https://github.com/jtleek/advdatasci/blob/gh-pages/lecture_notes/multipletesting/index.Rmd)

Next, we'll look at tools for exploratory data analysis:
 - Exploring your data set, testing to make sure data looks as expected, and other litmus tests [here](http://jtleek.com/genstats/inst/doc/01_10_exploratory-analysis.html)
    - data from the above is drawn from [ReCount](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/recount/)
 - clustering your data to examine the structure in your data [here](http://jtleek.com/genstats/inst/doc/01_13_clustering.html)

For more lessons on both clustering, exploratory data analysis and lots more modeling, check out Jeff Leek's Statistics for Genomics Data Science [course](https://github.com/jtleek/genstats)
